Prime Harmony
=============

Explore the harmonies of the primes.

1) The mouse x position defines the width of the drawing area
2) Each pixel is associated with a number n = x + width*y (x,y one-counting)
3) Each number (i.e. pixel) in the box is coloured according to whether it is prime:
    a) prime -> white
    b) otherwise -> black
4) redraw as the mouse moves
